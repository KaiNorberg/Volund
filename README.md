Volund is a OpenGL rendering engine designed for Windows 10/11.

***

## Getting Started

If you wish to use visual studio building Volund is as simple as cloning this repository and running the [RunPremake.bat](https://github.com/Kaj9296/Volund-2/blob/main/RunPremake.bat) batch file. If you wish to use a different platform simply run premake on the [premake5.lua](https://github.com/Kaj9296/Volund-2/blob/main/premake5.lua) premake file, and then hope for the best.

## Requirements

Visual studio 2022 is the only officially tested platform, however it should work with older version of VS and potentially other platforms.

To use Visual studio these components need to be installed:

Desktop development with c++  
C++ MFC (x86 & x64)  

## Goals:

The main goal for Volund is to create a versatile application capable of being used for anything from making games to 3D physics simulation. The hope is to achieve this versatility while maintaining ease of use and performance.

- PBR 3D rendering
- 3rd party 3D physics engine
- Audio 
- C# scripting
- Fully editable JSON files for storing all information about a scene
- A feature complete designer/editor
